## Data directory location

The data directory is the default location where the Groestlcoin Core files are stored.

1. The default data directory paths for supported platforms are:

Platform | Data directory path
---------|--------------------
Linux    | `$HOME/.groestlcoin/`
macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Groestlcoin/`
Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Groestlcoin\` <sup>[\[1\]](#note1)</sup>

2. A custom data directory path can be specified with the `-datadir` option.

3. All content of the data directory, except for `groestlcoin.conf` file, is chain-specific. This means the actual data directory paths for non-mainnet cases differ:

Chain option                     | Data directory path
---------------------------------|------------------------------
`-chain=main` (default)          | *path_to_datadir*`/`
`-chain=test` or `-testnet`      | *path_to_datadir*`/testnet3/`
`-chain=testnet4` or `-testnet4` | *path_to_datadir*`/testnet4/`
`-chain=signet` or `-signet`     | *path_to_datadir*`/signet/`
`-chain=regtest` or `-regtest`   | *path_to_datadir*`/regtest/`

## Data directory layout

Subdirectory       | File(s)               | Description
-------------------|-----------------------|------------

`wallets/`         |                       | [Contains wallets](#multi-wallet-environment); can be specified by `-walletdir` option; if `wallets/` subdirectory does not exist, wallets reside in the [data directory](#data-directory-location)
`./`               | `anchors.dat`         | Anchor IP address database, created on shutdown and deleted at startup. Anchors are last known outgoing block-relay-only peers that are tried to re-connect to on startup

`./`               | `settings.json`       | Read-write settings set through GUI or RPC interfaces, augmenting manual settings from [groestlcoin.conf](groestlcoin-conf.md). File is created automatically if read-write settings storage is not disabled with `-nosettings` option. Path can be specified with `-settings` option
`./`               | `.cookie`             | Session RPC authentication cookie; if used, created at start and deleted on shutdown; can be specified by `-rpccookiefile` option
`./`               | `.lock`               | Data directory lock file

## Multi-wallet environment

Wallets are SQLite databases.

1. Each user-defined wallet named "wallet_name" resides in the `wallets/wallet_name/` subdirectory.

2. The default (unnamed) wallet resides in `wallets/` subdirectory; if the latter does not exist, the wallet resides in the data directory.

3. A wallet database path can be specified with the `-wallet` option.

4. `wallet.dat` files must not be shared across different node instances, as that can result in key-reuse and double-spends due to the lack of synchronization between instances.

5. Any copy or backup of the wallet should be done through a `backupwallet` call in order to update and lock the wallet, preventing any file corruption caused by updates during the copy.


### SQLite database based wallets

Subdirectory | File                 | Description
-------------|----------------------|-------------
`./`         | `wallet.dat`         | Personal wallet (a SQLite database) with keys and transactions
`./`         | `wallet.dat-journal` | SQLite Rollback Journal file for `wallet.dat`. Usually created at start and deleted on shutdown. A user *must keep it as safe* as the `wallet.dat` file.


## GUI settings

`groestlcoin-qt` uses [`QSettings`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qsettings.html) class; this implies platform-specific [locations where application settings are stored](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qsettings.html#locations-where-application-settings-are-stored).

## Legacy subdirectories and files

These subdirectories and files are no longer used by Groestlcoin Core:

Path           | Description | Repository notes

`banlist.dat`  | Stores the addresses/subnets of banned nodes; superseded by `banlist.json` in 22.0 and completely ignored in 23.0
`blktree/`     | Blockchain index; replaced by `blocks/index/` in 2.1.0.6
`coins/`       | Unspent transaction output database; replaced by `chainstate/` in 2.1.0.6
`blkindex.dat` | Blockchain index BDB database; replaced by {`chainstate/`, `blocks/index/`, `blocks/revNNNNN.dat`<sup>[\[2\]](#note2)</sup>} in 2.1.0.6
`blk000?.dat`  | Block data (custom format, 2 GiB per file); replaced by `blocks/blkNNNNN.dat`<sup>[\[2\]](#note2)</sup> in 2.1.0.6
`addr.dat`     | Peer IP address BDB database; replaced by `peers.dat` in 2.1.0.6
`onion_private_key` | Cached Tor onion service private key for `-listenonion` option. Was used for Tor v2 services; replaced by `onion_v3_private_key` in 2.21.0

### Berkeley DB database based wallets

Subdirectory | File(s)           | Description

<a name="note1">1</a>. The `/` (slash, U+002F) is used as the platform-independent path component separator in this document.

<a name="note2">2</a>. `NNNNN` matches `[0-9]{5}` regex.

### Notes

- *Italicized* files are only installed in source builds if relevant CMake options are enabled. They are not included in binary releases.
- README and bitcoin.conf files are included in binary releases but not installed in source builds.
- On Windows, binaries have a `.exe` suffix (e.g., `bitcoin-cli.exe`).

## Filesystem recommendations

When choosing a filesystem for the data directory (`datadir`) or blocks directory (`blocksdir`) on **macOS**,the `exFAT` filesystem should be avoided.
There have been multiple reports of database corruption and data loss when using this filesystem with Bitcoin Core, see [Issue #31454](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31454) for more details.
